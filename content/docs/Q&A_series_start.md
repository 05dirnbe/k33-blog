## Questions and answers anyone? Anyone?

... let me explain. So it's been roughly two months now since I've took the leap of faith and started my own little business.
I admit that this move is a wager of sorts. I am rolling the dice on the quality of my knowledge of data science, software engineering and my scientific training in general. Plus, it has been said about me that I am a crafty individual. I don't know where this is going, but I am learning a ton already. Some of the things I learn I want to share via this blog.

So my mission is easy to state but difficult to explain. It has two vital parts that belong together. The first, part is something like the following: **Using the concepts of graphs to solve real-life problems**. And to do just that I focus on combining theoretical concepts and practical tools found in the world of graphs.

So what are these mysterious real-life problems you ask? Applicable problems are everywhere and come in all shapes and forms. When I say everywhere, I do mean it. For example:

- The question could be how to best store certain types of connected data to build a data science application on top of it?
- How to organize the communication between robots or sensors to make sure a piece of information is guaranteed to be available when needed?
- How to navigate a complex forest of processes by selecting paths that take us from A to B in the most efficient manner?

... and the list goes on.

It is fair to say that problems like these, problems that can be tackled using graph concepts are ubiquitous. You see, most of us have been thought all our lives to think in lists, rows or columns and the like. Think about todays todo list or your good old excel sheet. Well, these things are familiar and useful and there's nothing wrong with that.

However, we seem to live in a world that grows more interconnected by the day. In such a world, one would assume that thinking in terms of graphs should be a natural thing to do. I would even go as far as to say that people would naturally gravitate towards graph thinking if it were not for the fact, that graph concepts are not commonly known. It doesn't help one bit that graph problems are sometimes difficult to recognize as such. As a result, it quickly becomes difficult for people to see the point of graphs altogether. I can relate to that.

The situation is similar to mountaineering. Most people naturally enjoy the idea of getting fresh air and climbing beautiful unspoiled mountain ranges. However, many of them don't know that they lack something that is naturally useful in such environments: the proper training, knowledge and the tools required to navigate safely. Especially when wading into difficult and maybe even unknown territory, a well-versed mountain guide is what they need. An experienced and knowledgeable professional showing them the way. So to wrap up the metaphor: I am to graphs what a mountain guide is to mountains. Note that, people in need of a mountain guide typically at least recognize the fact that they are moving in mountainous territory. People that move in a territory where graphs are key often don't realize where they are at.

Thus, the second part of my mission can be phrased like this: **Showing them the territory of graphs and becoming the guide they need**. To introduce people to graph concepts and to put them in a position that allows them to look at the problems they grapple with from a new point of view - the vantage point of graphs!

Needless to say, graphs are extremely useful but no miracle cure. I am of the firm opinion however, that the ability to look at problems from different angles is strictly beneficial. So why not add graph thinking to the old toolbox?

Let me go out of character for a moment and allow me to rephrase my mission in the language of (what I take for) modern marketing: First, I enable the type of graph thinking that helps companies navigate and succeed in an interconnected world. Second, in this interconnected world, I help build the solutions they need to drive their business models.

Admittedly, there is limited tangible information in these statements, but they sure sounds more flashy than everything else I wrote today.

Currently I find, that I spend a significant portion of my time working on the second part of my mission. That entails listening and talking to people which it is fun and instructive.
Whenever there is a conference, a start-up pitch or some other form of business event, I'll show up simply to meet people. If you do that consistently, it turns out that you meet lots of interesting people that are eager to talk.

Most of the talking on my part revolves around explaining what it is that I do. Basically, I talk about the things you just read up to this point. Explaining the idea of graphs, sketching the importance and the practical impact of the application of those ideas and why people should care to take a look. And so on and so forth ...

Every now and then, I run into a person that is surprisingly well-informed (i.e. the enthusiast mountaineer), but it seems that for most people the idea of graphs is at best fairly new. As a result I explain the same things multiple times per day. It can be exhausting, but as long as people are curious and willing to learn I don't mind that. Plus, I enjoy the fact, that there are very little misconceptions attached to the topic of graphs as of yet. There is little to no public opinion - no exaggerations, no hype. It's refreshing. Compare this situation to what is happening around AI and Machine Learning. Notice a difference?

### ... so long story short, when I'm out I get lots and lots of questions, many of them repeatedly.

And that is a good thing, since it shows that people are interested. People who know me will testify that I was never one to carefully prepare my answers beforehand (the better the questions, the lower the chance for me guessing them ahead of time). As a result I end up improvising answers on the spot based on what I know at that point in time. That works well enough, mostly because I've had plenty of opportunity (and indeed plenty of need) to develop this skill during my post-graduate studies (Answering crazy questions after a conference talk anyone?).

I don't really know why, but I have the strong feeling that questions are more likely to lead to interesting discussions when a bit of improvisation is in play.

So seeing that there are plenty of interesting questions out there, I decided to start recording them and the discussions revolving around them. Thus I hereby start a Q&A series on my blog where I aim to reproduce the key takeaways of things that happen to me "in the field".

First and foremost, me jotting things down makes sure that I don't forget them for now. It'll hopefully help me to stay consistent. But, if others find one or two interesting thoughts to take away amongst my ramblings, I will pronounce that a success.

I am not gonna lie, however, I don't know how frequent these posts will be for it takes time to produce a thought of quality and put it in semi-proper writing. I guess the future will tell.

If there's a topic you, brave reader who made it all the way to the end, want me to cover, don't hesitate to get in touch. I will see what I can do. But please, no crazy requests, only if you must!
