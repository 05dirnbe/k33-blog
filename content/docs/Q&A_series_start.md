## Anyone interested in Q&A?

... but let me explain. So it's been roughly two months since I've took the leap of faith and started my own little business.
It's a wager of sorts. I am betting on my knowledge of data science, software engineering and my scientific training in general. Plus, it has been said about me that I am a crafty individual.

That being said, at the heart of my mission is to use the rather abstract concept of graphs to tackle problems within these fields that are very practical in nature. If I were a marketing person, I might say something like "I aim to promote the type of graph thinking that helps other companies navigate and succeed in an interconnected world". But that doesn't really mean anything does it?

Anyways, in my daily doings I find, that I spend a large part of my time listening and talking to people. That's fun and instructive.
Whenever there is a conference, a start-up pitch or some other form of business event, I'll show up simply to meet people. If you do that
consistently, it turns out that you meet lots of interesting people that are eager to talk.
Most of the talking on my part revolves around explaining what it is that I do.
Explaining the idea of graphs, sketching the importance and the practical impact of the application of those ideas and why people should care to take a look. And so on and so forth ...

Every now and then, I run into a person that is surprisingly up to speed, but it seems that for most people the idea of graphs is new. As a result I explain the same things over and over, but as long as people are curious and willing to learn I don't mind that. Plus, I enjoy the fact, that there are very little misconceptions attached to the topic of graphs as of yet. There is little to no public opinion - no exaggerations, no hype. It's refreshing. Compare this situation to the hype around AI and Machine Learning if you will ...

### ... so long story short, when I'm out I get lots and lots of questions, many of them repeatedly.

And that is a good thing, since it shows that people are interested. People who know me will testify that I was never one to carefully prepare my answers beforehand (the better the questions, the lower the chance for me guessing them ahead of time). As a result I end up improvising answers on the spot based on what I know at that point in time. That works well enough, mostly because I've had plenty of opportunity (and indeed plenty of need) to develop this skill during my post-graduate studies (Answering questions after your conference talk anyone?).

I don't really know why, but I have the strong feeling that questions are more likely to lead to interesting discussions when a bit of improvisation is in play.

So seeing that there are plenty of interesting questions out there, I decided to start recording them and the discussions revolving around them. Thus I hereby start a Q&A series on my blog where I aim to reproduce the key takeaways of things that happen to me "in the field".

First and foremost, me jotting things down makes sure that I don't forget them. But, if others find one or two interesting thoughts to take away amongst my ramblings, I will pronounce that a success.

I am not gonna lie, however, I don't know how frequent these posts will be. I guess the future will tell. If there's a topic you, dear reader, want me to cover, don't hesitate to get in touch. I will see what I can do.
