## A: Practically all industries, at least they should!

Well, I guess that is my go-to answer to the question of what industries are using graphs. But let me discuss this in more detail.

When I am out meeting people, I frequently talk to CEOs, Department heads and other decision makers. When I introduce them to the idea of graphs, I always start with with, well ... nodes and edges.

I explain to them that nodes are abstract objects first and foremost. They represent all possible sorts of entities. In concrete practical applications they can be people, products or machines. Really, anything goes.

The same is true with edges. The represent the abstract relations between abstract objects. Edges can, of course, have practical meaning. They can indicate that you and I are friends. Or that one machines communicates with a bunch of other machines. Again anything goes.

Nodes and edges together form the graph. The graph at first, is an abstract way of describing how objects are connected to each other. Graphs can take many forms in practical realizations. The fact that you and I are friends Indicate that that we are part of the same social circle. Machines that exchange information form a communication network.

The list of practical realizations of the graph concept is very long. Basically, if you are creative and blessed with some imagination, you will find that it is not difficult to see graphs and their realizations all around you.

Typically people tend to associate graphs with all things IT. It is natural because, they use facebook, google maps, twitter and whatnot and it is not hard to make them understand that these things are fundamentally based on the concept of graphs. However, it is a mistake to think that these concepts are restricted to the domain of IT. For example, take a look at mother Nature. She connects the neurons in our brains with each other to form a complex network (please do not mistake the complex networks in our brains with the neural networks you might have seen in the context of Machine Learning). The blood vessels connect throughout our bodies forming an intricate vascular network enabling circulation of blood. You don't even have to look past the human body to find a host of practical realizations of the graph concept.

It is no exaggeration to say that practical networks have been around forever. Practical things that stood the test of time up until now are likely to be here in the future. Graphs a simply a tool that allows us to reason consistently about the many, many examples of graph-realizations we find everywhere. But I digress ...

So at this point I have tried to introduce the basic concept of graphs to my conversation partner. To illustrate the idea that the abstract concepts has many many realizations I present various examples of networks and they applications. This also servers to steer the conversation from a purely abstract level to something that is more tangible for most people.

As I said in the beginning I frequently talk to CEOs, Department heads and other decision makers. When we arrive at this point, their instincts kick in and they want to gauge if these mysterious graphs are something that could be useful for them. Thus they like to ask the following question:

## Q: What industries use graphs?

What is sometimes difficult for me is, that these people have the right idea right away, a desire to learn more about the usefulness of graphs, but they somehow miss the point that I made a moment ago. Namely, graphs are everywhere! When a company is working with structured connected data, graph concepts apply. When a company is teaching robots how to pass a message from one bot to the next, graph concepts apply. When a company wants to better understand the various processes they have to go from State A to State B, whatever the definition of the States, graph concepts apply.

Graph concepts will always apply when abstract objects are connected to each other in meaningful ways. Can you think of another example of an extremely versatile abstract tool that applies almost everywhere? I can - it's programming concepts. Mastering the concepts of programming and programming languages is extremely useful because it applies to so many problems everywhere you look.

Would you ask the question, what industries use programming? I'd guess you wouldn't. You probably have already accepted the fact that programming is used everywhere. It is clear that all industries that operate IT systems will always have use for programmers. The value of programmers does not stem from the fact that they are employed in the automotive industry, insurance industry or even in IT dominated industries. It is precisely the opposite, their value is high because of what they bring to the table is abstract and thus it applies virtually always.

The same thing is true for the concepts of graphs and graph applications. Remember how I claimed that graph concepts will apply whenever objects are connected to each other in a meaningful way. Just as almost all industries operate IT systems, almost all industries operate objects that are connected in a meaningful way. The value of graph concepts and graph thinking does not stem from the fact that these things are used in the IT industry. It is precisely the opposite, their value is high because of what they bring to the table is abstract and thus it applies virtually always.

I find it very interesting to see that people have been exposed to programming enough to accept it's cross-industry nature. How long did that take. 20 years, 30 years, maybe even longer. I suppose we are not at that point yet when it comes to graphs but I am fairly sure it won't take decades to get there. In a world that grows more connected and thus more complex every day, it is fairly safe to assume that graphs and graph applications will be getting more attention soon. Certainly so if I get to say something on the matter.

I summarize, for the illustrated reasons practically all industries should concern themselves with graphs, at least on some level. I am not saying they must, but they clearly stand to benefit from concerning themselves with graphs. Likewise they stand to fall behind if they don't.

## Ok, Ok, we get it, but if that is true, how do I know whether I should look at graphs or not?

You see, this question is much easier to answer. It shifts the focus away from the high-level industrial domains down to the actual people grappling with the problems they need to solve on a daily basis.

Personally, I identify three professional roles that are likely to face situations where having graphs in the toolbox might just be a life-saver.

- Data Scientist and other professionals that dabble in the analysis of data.
- Software Engineers and other professionals that dabble in the organization, storage and retrieval of data.
- Decision-makes that stand at the helm of businesses that rely on data.

**As a rule of thumb: If in your work the connections between objects are at least as important as the objects themselves, it is likely that you can benefit greatly from investing time to look at graph concepts and graph tools.**

The professions listed above are likely to be found in a modern data-driven business, however keep in mind that what they bring to the table is abstract. Thus you should expect to find specimen across all industries. In a world that grows increasingly connected across all domains it becomes increasingly likely that the very data these professionals work with fits the criterion stated above.

Think about it for second. Does the data you or your department work with look more like a phone book, i.e. a long list of sorted names and numbers or does it more look like a web of various pieces of information that are interconnected, i.e. a graph? In reality it is likely that you end up somewhere in the middle.

However, theres another thing that I always stress when I talk to CEOs, department heads and decision makes: there is no guarantee that using graph concepts and graph tools is the right way to go. A careful consideration on a case-to-case basis is required to decide which technology to deploy. Which, by the way, is true for all technologies not just for graphs. As a result graphs should be treated like another useful technology that has its benefits and drawbacks.

Speaking of which, given the length of todays post, I will postpone a discussion of said benefits and drawbacks for now. This topic deserves a post on its own.
