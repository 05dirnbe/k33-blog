Greetings stranger, my name is Michael and I am a profesisonal geek from Graz, Austria. I am into Programming, Science and Technology and am always looking to learn or teach useful stuff :zap: :fire: :zap:.


The k33 blog is where I casually write about things I encounter, try out for the first time, find interesting and/or worth spreading. Take a look at the tags cloud :cloud: in the sidebar or the [archive](archive) :file_folder: in the main menu to see what goes on here.


Over at [k33 Experts](http://localhost:62133/en/) you can find the all the all serious business  me :briefcase: :seedling: :chart_with_upwards_trend:, but let's face it, it's good to hang out here from time to time :v:.
